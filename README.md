--> Bookify — Smart Bookmark Manager Chrome Extension.
📌 Description

Bookify is a lightweight and efficient Chrome extension designed to simplify bookmark management. Unlike Chrome’s default Bookmark Manager — which often becomes slow and cluttered — Bookify provides a clean popup interface for quick saving, instant searching, and fast access to organized bookmarks.

It solves the problem of messy bookmark folders by offering categorized storage, real-time search, and a minimal UI that helps users find saved pages in seconds.

⭐ One-Click Bookmarking

Instantly save the current tab with auto-fetched title and URL.

📂 Bookmark Categories

Organize bookmarks into custom folders for cleaner navigation.

🔍 Real-Time Search

Search instantly by title, URL, or tags with dynamic filtering.

⚡ Minimal & Fast UI

Clean popup interface designed for speed and ease of use.

🔄 Sync Support

Uses chrome.storage.sync, keeping your bookmarks available across all Chrome devices.

🔗 Quick Access

Open any saved bookmark from the popup with a single click.
